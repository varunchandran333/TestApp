# Application to Learn use of Flow and Compose in Kotlin
This is a sample application which enables to understand how to integrate Kotlin, Coroutines, flow, Koin DI and write unitest for MVVM architecture.

You can simply load the code using the git url updated all the latest version as of now, use java 17 in android studio.
## Optimizations

This is a first release with sample data, will be adding more UIs and in next release will be adding the navigation using jet pack compose.
